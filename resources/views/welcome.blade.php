					<p>Somehow many gals seem to shop for their imaginary lives and I am no exception.  I usually buy things I don't wear much. In my imaginary life, I live in New York city, I have an incredible wardrode, I can afford great designers, I have a party every weekend, and many museum openings to attend.</p>

					<p>In reality, I spend my days working on a computer, I have a limited social life, I am just too happy spending time at home with my boyfriend.  I don't spend to pretend, but from time to time, I purchase quality clothing that makes me happy.</p>

					<p>This is my imaginary closet, a result of a major fantasy shopping spree.  The main purpose of this web application is for me to document my clothing wishes and to allow my friends to view my fantasy closet. If my friends want to contribute by adding items I should have, that would be great as well. My close friends can also delete items they believe are not ideal.  This is not a complete list, just a few items to create an imaginary closet and to demonstrate a real PHP/Laravel web application.</p>	

					<p>Please make sure to login to enjoy!</p>
